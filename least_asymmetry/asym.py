    Calculate the center of an input array by first switching the array into
    asymmetry space and finding the minimum

    This function takes in an input two dimentional array `data`, with a certain
    distribution of values, such as the flux from a star. The center of this
    distribution of values is based on the idea that the center will be the
    point of minimum asymmetry. To convert to asymmetry space, the asymmetry of
    a radial profile about a particular pixel is calculated according to
    sum(var(r)*Npts(r)), the sum of the variance about a particular radius times
    the number of points at that radius. The outter radius of consideration is
    set by `asym_rad`. The number of points that are converted to asymmetry
    space is governed by `asym_size` producing a shape `asym_size`*2+1 by
    `asym_size`*2+1. This asymmetry space is recalculated and moved succesively
    until the point of minimum asymmetry is in the center of the array or
    `maxcounts` is reached. Traditional Gaussian or center of light centering is
    then used in the asymmetry space to find the sub-pixel point of minimum
    asymmetry.

    Parameters
    --------------
    data: 2D array    this is the data to be worked on, the radius of the array
                      should at minimum be asym_size times 2. radius being
                      defined as the cut size, ie data[yxguess[0]-rad:yxguess[0]
                      +rad+1,yxguess[1]-rad:yxguess[1]+rad+1] a recomendation
                      would be asym_size times 3 or 4, to account for the
                      searching of the algorithmu

    yxguess: tuple    This contains a tuple, or 1x2 array, that contains the
                      guess of the center, this is used as the starting location
                      of the transform

    asym_rad: int     The integer used to define the span of the radial profile
                      used in the asym calculation

    asym_size: int    This sets the radius of the asym space that is used to
                      determine the center. The larger the radius of the star
                      in flux space, the larger this variable should be

    maxcounts: int    An int to set the number of times the routine is allowed
                      to walk trying to put the point of minimum asymmetry in
                      the center of the array

    method: string    Must be "gaus" to used gaussian for sub pixel, or "col"
                      for center of light sub pixel

    half_pix: Bool    Default false, if set to true asymmetry will be calculated
                      for all the half pixel location between the integers
                      contained in the asym array. This may be more accurate,
                      but much slower. If set, it is recommended to use a larger
                      value for `asym_rad`.

    resize: float     Though by default False, set to a float which will be the
                      factor the asym the array is resized before centering.
                      Reccomend scale factors 5 or below. Resizeing introduces a
                      bit of error in the center by itself, but may be
                      combensated by the gains in percision. test with care.
                      This WILL slow the function down noticably.

    weights: array    This is an array the same size as the input data, each
                      point contains the weighting that each point should
                      recive. low number is less weight, should be type float,
                      if none is given the weights are set to one.

    Returns
    ---------------
    numpy array:      A 1x2 array containing the found center of the data

    numpy array:      Array that contains the asymmery values calculated from
                      the input array

    Raises
    ---------------
    Possibly an runtime error, it the size of the radial profile is different
    than a given view of the data. This is most likely due to a boundary issue,
    aka the routine is trying to move out of the boundary of the input data.
    This can be caused by incorrect sizes for asym_rad & asym_size, or becuase
    the routine is trying to walk off the edge of data searching for the point
    of minimum asymmetry. If this happens, try reducing asym_size, or maxcounts
